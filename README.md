# Logger library

### This is a logger library that supports:

1. Logging message to a file in the following format: `timestamp, log level: message`
2. Supports logging to `Txt` and `PDF` file types
3. Thread-safe: can be invoked by multiple threads

Included some tests in the 'Test' folder.

* Dependent on the Apache PDFBox 2.0.13 library
